NameNode in Hadoop Cluster:

NameNode is the Masternode of HDFS file system in hadoop.
-It stores metadata and informations of its slave nodes. 
-Namenode also maintains the information of all addresses of the files/blocks in the file system and.
-NameNode don't store the data of all of its slave nodes.
-NameNode knows how to construct the file from blocks kept in different clusters. 
During Hadop 1.x, NameNode was the single point of failure,the Hadoop cluster was considered down if the namenode fails. 
In Hadoop 2.x, a secondary NameNode is present which acts as a backup node to provide high availability.
High availablity ensures when the active namenode goes down, Secondary namenode becomes active.
